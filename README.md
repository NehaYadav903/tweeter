# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a single-page Twitter clone, where users can create short posts of up to 140 characters and have them append to the main page.To do so, Tweeter fetches a list of posts from a simplified ‘server’ and allows users to add posts to this list dynamically.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.
